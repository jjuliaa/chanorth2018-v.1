Process Park focuses on reinserting ourselves into the act of production, to interrupt the paradigm of contemporary alienation.

Our Working Framework is based on the Keleketla! Library's model of community education, an experimental library and collective based in Johannesburg, South Africa: https://keleketla.org/. The Keleketla! Book (58 Years Since the Treason Trial) is meant to be used in different contexts, to process through the meaning of a place, generate a collaborative framework for artists, educators, and creative practitioners, and think through documentation of a collective effort.

“Plans are not made with clear and prescribed end points. Plans are made for the journey, and decisions are made along the way.”    
 	
Framework of Process Park Cycle:                                                                 	           	

<strong>Space for Conversation</strong>\\<strong>Space for Consideration</strong>\\<strong>Space for Implementation</strong>

 <ul>Conversation: Dinner, Text, Interpretation</ul>
<ul>Consideration: Sleep, Dream, Associate: Verbal Reflection – Written Reflection in Github – any and all manner of visual, video, and object responses</ul>
  <ul>Implementation: Work/Practice, Techne, Lunch</ul>

<p>The Process of Archiving: Archiving, documenting, and writing about the cycles of Conversation, Consideration, and Implementation, will be a key ongoing <em>process!</em> during the residency month. Contribute your thoughts for each cycle in the corresponding Project Column by licking the + on your column. 
 
This will become our collective work, thinking through texts, our writing here during consideration sessions, our conversations and insights generated during site visits, and any and all material deposited into the residency Github. 

The goal is to have, through the Github, a repository of our findings, a way to track our overlaps and intersections as a group, and a method for forking off new strands of inquiry – material, made, or otherwise.

Discussions of the texts will take place over dinner, after reading together.
